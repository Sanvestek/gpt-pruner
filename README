# GPT-Pruner ✂️

> **Instantly declutter your ChatGPT DOM to reclaim browser performance.**

When conversations grow long, ChatGPT keeps every single message in the browser's memory. This leads to high CPU usage, "stuttery" scrolling, and general lag. **GPT-Pruner** solves this by safely removing old message elements from the current view.

## 🏗️ Architecture (First Principles)

This extension utilizes a **Decoupled Injection** pattern:

* **Interface:** A lightweight `popup.html` provides the user controls.
* **Execution:** The `chrome.scripting` API injects logic directly into the active tab.
* **Memory Management:** We target the `<article>` tags with `data-testid="conversation-turn-"` to prune the DOM tree without breaking React's internal state.
