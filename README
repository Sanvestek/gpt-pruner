# GPT-Pruner ✂️

**GPT-Pruner** is a high-performance developer utility for heavy ChatGPT users. When conversations grow long, the browser struggle to render thousands of DOM elements, leading to "laggy" scrolling and high CPU usage. 

This extension allows you to "prune" the viewable history to only the most recent messages, instantly freeing up system resources.

## 🚀 Features
- **Instant DOM Pruning:** Remove old message elements from the current view with one click.
- **Customizable Depth:** Choose how many recent messages to keep (Default is 3).
- **Non-Destructive:** Only affects the current browser session. Refresh the page to bring back full history from OpenAI's servers.
- **Privacy Focused:** Runs entirely locally. No data is collected or sent to third parties.

## 🛠️ Installation (Developer Mode)
Since this is a custom developer tool, install it via Chrome's "Unpacked" mode:

1. **Clone or Download** this repository to your local machine.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** using the toggle in the top-right corner.
4. Click **Load unpacked**.
5. Select the folder containing the extension files.

## 📖 How to Use
1. Open any [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) conversation.
2. Click the **GPT-Pruner** icon in your extension toolbar.
3. Select the number of messages you wish to keep visible.
4. Click **Prune Now** and watch your browser performance recover.

## 🏗️ Architecture (First Principles)
This app follows a **Decoupled Injection** pattern:
- **UI:** A standard HTML/JS popup for user input.
- **Logic:** Direct DOM manipulation via the `chrome.scripting` API.
- **Performance:** By removing `article` tags with the `data-testid="conversation-turn-"` attribute, we reduce the browser's paint and reflow calculations.
